# Monitoring Core Module version 1.10.3

`kubeadm` versions starting from `1.17` are not exposing `kube-controller-manager` nor `kube-scheduler` metrics
over the insecure port *(respectively TCP/10252 and TCP/10251)*.
This makes the current `ServiceMonitor` configuration unable to properly scrape these targets.

## Changelog

- FIX #51: `kubeadm-sm` package to proper configure `serviceMonitors` to solve `kubeadm` +1.17 versions.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.10.2` to `v1.10.3`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/kubeadm-sm | kubectl apply -f -
```
