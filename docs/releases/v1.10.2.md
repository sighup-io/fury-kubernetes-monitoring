# Monitoring Core Module version 1.10.2

The previous 1.10.1 release fixes a couple of issues in the Fury alerting stack.
This release solves another problem, the `NodeMachineIDCollision` was deleted in 1.10.0.

## Changelog

- Add `NodeMachineIDCollision` as it was previously there.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.10.1` to `v1.10.2`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/prometheus-operated | kubectl apply -f -
```
