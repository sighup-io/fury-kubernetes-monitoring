# Monitoring Core Module version 1.10.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.19 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Grafana Labs released a major release of its flagship product, Grafana 7. SIGHUP includes the latest Grafana
