## Add new dashboards

You can create a Configmap in your project with a json of a grafana dashboard and then labelling it with the labal key = "grafana-sighup-dashboard", the value of the label is up to you (for mental healthness should be better that the value respects some sort of reference with the project to with the dashboard is related). Labelling it, the sidecar k8s-sidecar will take care of it and inject it into a shared volume where grafana does a lookup and discover it. Look at the  [dashboards](dashboards) folder kustomization.yml for an example.

## Deployment

You can deploy Grafana by running following command in the root of the project:

```shell
$ kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Accessing Grafana UI

You can access Grafana Dashboard by port-forwarding on port `3000`:

```shell
$ kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 --namespace monitoring
```

Grafana will be available on http://127.0.0.1:3000 from your browser.
